#  Homework - Binary Heap
#
#  Problem: Binary Heap Class
#
#  Prompt: Create a Heap class/constructor
#
#  The Heap will take in the following input:
#
#                type: argument should be either 'min' or 'max'. This will
#                      dictate whether the heap will be a minheap or maxheap.
#                      The comparator method will be affected by this
#                      argument. See method description below
#
#  The Heap will have the following property:
#
#             storage: list
#
#                type: property that will be either 'min' or 'max'. This will
#                      be dictated by
#
#  The Heap will have the following methods:
#
#             compare: takes in two arguments (a and b). Depending on the heap
#                      type (minheap or maxheap), the comparator will behave
#                      differently. If the heap is a minheap, then the compare
#                      function will return true if a is less than b, false
#                      otherwise. If the heap is a maxheap, then the compare
#                      function will return true if a is greater than b, false
#                      otherwise.
#
#                swap: takes in two indexes and swaps the elements at the two
#                      indexes in the storage list
#
#                peak: returns the peak element of the storage list. This
#                      will be the most minimum and maximum element for a
#                      minheap and maxheap respectively
#
#                size: returns the number of elements in the heap
#
#              insert: inserts a value into the heap. Should begin by pushing
#                      the value onto the end of the list, and then calling
#                      the bubbleUp method from the last index of the list
#
#           bubble_up: takes in an index, and considers the element at that
#                      index to be a child. Continues to swap that child with
#                      its parent value if the heap comparator condition is
#                      not fulfilled
#
#         remove_peak: removes the peak element from the heap and returns it.
#                      Should begin by swapping the 0th-index element with the
#                      last element in the storage list. Uses bubbleDown
#                      method from the 0th index
#
#         bubble_down: takes in an index, and considers the element at this
#                      index to be the parent. Continues to swap this parent
#                      element with its children if the heap comparator
#                      condition is not fulfilled
#
#              remove: takes in a value and (if it exists in the heap),
#                      removes that value from the heap data structure and
#                      returns it. Should rearrange the rest of the heap to
#                      ensure the heap comparator conditions are fulfilled
#                      for all of its elements
#
#
#
#  Input:  N/A
#  Output: A Heap instance
#
#  What are the time and auxilliary space complexities of the various methods?
